# New Project Track Data Analysis
# "Visualizing Nigeria’s GDP Journey (1993–2025): A Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Perspective"

# Project Introduction / Preamble
  So, I decided to embark on a personal data analytical project to draw out deep insights from Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) trends. This project spans from 1993 to 2025, a       critical period post-independence reflecting Nigeria’s evolving economic framework, government reforms, and international positioning.
  I will be imploring the use of Power BI and other advanced data analytical skills—including Excel, Python, and statistical methods—to carry out this research. The aim is not just to     analyze GDP growth and decline, but to understand:
 
   When and why the Nigerian economy grew significantly

   What investments or policies contributed to such growth

   What caused declines, stagnation, or economic slowdowns

   How these trends inform scalable growth opportunities for Nigeria’s future

   This project is a blend of research, business intelligence, and economic storytelling, grounded in data. I’ll be using:

   Power BI dashboards for dynamic visualization

   Time-series and regression analysis for modeling trends

   Correlation and inferential tools to tie macroeconomic events to outcomes

# Invitation to Join the Journey
    I invite you to join me on this exciting research and business intelligence journey into Nigeria’s GDP. Whether you are a data analyst, economist, policymaker, or simply curious         about Nigeria’s economic development—this project is for you.

    Stay tuned as we uncover hidden insights, spot economic patterns, and bring data to life in the Nigerian context.
